# Code-Refactor
# This is an On-the-job ticket

### Description -- For User


This Unit involved refactoring a webpage, improving links and id's in the HTML and in the CSS, making it consise and ordering the styles in the CSS to follow the order of the HTML and removing extraneous information and styles but putting the header elements like h1, h2 in same row to target them on the page using similar fonts that were not repetitive.  A good start but it would have been nice and interesting to refactor a more complicated site, though it was nice to work with columns and rows which is now improved with Bootstrap which are using now.  It's good to go over this homework to see how our skills have developed in css and html 2 months afterward.  Also, this is where we learned GitHub!

### How to

Instructions to create project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

6.  Copy the develop fles from DU Virtual Develop folder from the DU Bootcamp Repository hoemework into the Unit1-Code-Refactor folder onto local desktop.
