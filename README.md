### User Story

<!-- This webpage is a marketing page and has a simple design with images as placeholders and three navidgation links at the top that jump down and target each image within the page.  The top heading area is a bluehish gray with large white text with links down to the main section on the left side of the page. The name of the company, Horiseon has larger text. The 'SEO' of the title is a different gracolor within the word Horiseon. Just down from the top heading area is an image of a modern business setting with people sitting around a work table. 

The content's background has a neutral white background color.  Each section has a light blue background and white text and padding on each side. Below the primary image, is the content section

The content in the main section to the left is linked down from the navigation bar.  Each of the segments are padded with a border to separate them and colored a light blue. The first segment is titled Search Optimization with an image of a student's table with a computer, a pencil, pens, coffee and a notepad with SEO on it. The text in the box is colored white with the blue background similar to the rest of the sections on the page. The next segment below is titled Online Reputation management with text describing being on the internet and having control over what people see on your webpage. The image in that segment is of a laptop on a wood table showing a picture that says reputation.  The last part of the content is labeled Social Media Marketing.

To the right of the main sedtion is a sidebar.  The page has a sidebar colored in light blue with white text.  It has parts that has sections that include Lead Generation and underneath Cost Management, down to Brand Awareness with each segment having component text that describes them.   

Lastly the is a copyright text in smaller text to end the page. 

It is not in responsive design, meaning that it does not look as well with smaller devices just on desktops like a laptop or computer-

The site follows accesibility standards that allows for screen readers to read the alternative text for images.->

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Horiseon Marketing website Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/efurness/Unit1-Code-Refactor.git)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I set up this project by making a new repository called Unit1-Code-Refactor at Git Hub and cloned a local copy using my Terminal to my desktop.  I then opened a new window in Visual Studio Code to get it up and running.  I copied the develop fles to the folder on desktop.  I am working on the index.html, CSS style sheet, and the README.md files.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

   ```
3. Install NPM packages
